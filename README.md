This is an attempt at the challenge.

The backend and front end are not wired perfectly, as I have yet to add in test cases for them but they are communicating nicely!

Git Clone this directery. In terminal or command prompt, type in npm install to install needed dependencies.

-   To start the server and app, I added a small script. You just need to type in npm run server and the app will boot up after a bit. This is only working on linux based systems though. For windows, run npm run windows command in command prompt, then run npm start for react portion.

There are a number of goals still with this application.

I was unable to complete the bonus challenges within the completed time, as well as some of the actual challenge goals. I am going to keep working on it past the time because I am having fun doing so. I also wasn't able to start this whole project till saturday due to work so want to see if I can actually complete it.

An active route button was put on the current driver page to render the leg of the current route over the static route layout. I have yet to add in the minor calculation for the line to go past the start point of the current leg, need to review a bit of line segment math, lol! but pretty sure I know the calculations.
